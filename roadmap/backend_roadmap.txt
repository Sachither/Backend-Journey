BACKEND DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY — ONE CONCEPT, ONE PROJECT AT A TIME
----------------------------------------------------------------

This roadmap is structured around core backend concepts. Each week focuses on one concept and a small project to apply it.

Week 1 – Language Foundations
- Choose: Python 
- Project: Command-line To-Do App using file-based storage
- Concepts: CRUD, file I/O, modules, clean code

Week 2 – Version Control (Git)
- Project: Add Git version control to To-Do App
- Concepts: git init, commit history, branches, remote GitHub repo, README

Week 3 – Databases
- Integrate: SQLite, Postgres (Python)

Week 5 – Authentication
- Add: JWT (or session) authentication to API endpoints
- Concepts: Token handling, middleware protection

Week 6 – Testing & Validation
- Add: Unit tests and input validation
- Concepts: Auto testing, validation, code reliability

Week 7 – Caching & Optimization
- Add: Caching layer (in-memory or Redis)
- Project: Cache GET responses
- Concepts: Performance, state management

Week 8 – Deployment
- Deploy App: Heroku, Render, or Docker
- Concepts: Environment variables, cloud deployment

Week 9 – Logging & Monitoring
