# Backend Development Journey

This repository documents my backend developer pathway, focusing on learning one concept through a small, hands-on project at a time.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- **roadmap/**: Long-term concept roadmap & 30-day learning calendar
- **project-ideas.txt**: A list of backend project
- **writeups/**: Markdown writeups for each project
- **tools-notes/**: Concept-specific notes (e.g., Git, Auth)
- **templates/**: Reusable writeup template

## My Goals:
- Build practical skills (APIs, databases, authentication, deployment)
- Document every step as portfolio-ready work
- Progress with structure and consistency
